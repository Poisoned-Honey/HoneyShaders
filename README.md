# Honey Shaders

Shaderpack for [Canvas Renderer](https://github.com/vram-guild/canvas). Adds a customizable shader pipeline to the game that has a stylized fantasy aesthetic.

This is in early alpha at the moment, and may not look very pretty. It has several noticeable bugs and visual artifacts. However, it is playable for normal gameplay. Providing feedback and reporting bugs is greatly appreciated.

## Currently adds:

- Bloom that supports realistic emissivity values
- Tonemapping & HDR
- Custom sky & fog
- Support for vanilla effects
- Fancy extra shader effects for various vanilla situations
- Many misc & meme effects. For those that like fun!

## Known issues:

- Poorly optimized
- Doesn't seem to work with Mac/Linux with blur options enabled (bloom, underwater/translucent blur)
