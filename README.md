# Honey Shaders

Shaderpack for the [Canvas Renderer](https://github.com/vram-guild/canvas). Adds a customizable pipeline to the game which works best with material shaders to accompany.

This is in early alpha at the moment, and may not look very pretty. It has several noticeable bugs and visual artifacts.

## Currently adds:

- Bloom that supports realistic emissivity values more reminiscent to that of real life, completely customizable (WIP)
- Tonemapping & HDR (WIP)
- Support for vanilla effects
- Fancy extra shader effects for various vanilla situations
- Many misc & memey effects. For those that like fun!

## Known issues:

- Some objects look strange with bloom. For example, entities will have bloom if against the sky.
- Some visual artifacts
- Poor performance
- Some config options may not work correctly 
- The shaderpack is generally very incomplete, but suitable for normal gameplay. Though I wouldn't recommend using it if you want to take pretty screenshots.
