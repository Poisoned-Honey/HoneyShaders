# Honey Shaders

Shaderpack for the [Canvas Renderer](https://github.com/vram-guild/canvas). Adds a customizable pipeline to the game which works best with material shaders to accompany.

This is in early alpha at the moment, and may not look very pretty. It has several noticeable bugs and visual artifacts. However, it is playable for normal gameplay. Providing feedback and reporting bugs is greatly appreciated.

## Currently adds:

- Bloom that supports realistic emissivity values
- Tonemapping & HDR
- Custom sky
- Support for vanilla effects
- Fancy extra shader effects for various vanilla situations
- Many misc & memey effects. For those that like fun!

## Known issues:

- Poorly optimized
- Fire overlay doesn't appear when the player is on fire
- Many things are incomplete
