# Honey Shaders

Shaders for Canvas. Adds a pipeline to the game, which works best with material shaders to accompany.

## Currently adds:

- Bloom that applies to both terrain and the sun & moon
- Underwater & under lava tinting and blur
- More is planned!

## Known issues:

- Bloom "lags" behind the original image
- Hand bloom currently doesn't work properly and some objects will look weird with bloom.
- Some visual artifacts & probably poor performance
- The shaderpack is generally very incomplete, but is suitable for normal gameplay. I wouldn't recommend using it if you want pretty images.

# Credits

- Xordev for providing me permission to use their blur function from the [Ominous Shaderpack](https://github.com/XorDev/Ominous-Shaderpack) (used for bloom and blur effects)

- Spiralhalo's [Canvas Tutorial](https://github.com/spiralhalo/CanvasTutorial/wiki) for teaching me how to make a Canvas pipeline. Also credits to their shaderpack [Lumi Lights](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLights) for being a great example for a working pipeline.

- Grondag, author of Canvas and FREX, for creating and maintaining such a nice shader API.
